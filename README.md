# SoftSell

This is my submission for the credex web dev internship task. 

### Tech stack used:
1. NextJS for the overall framework
2. Shadcn as the ui library of choice
3. Typescript instead of javascript for typesafe code
4. ESlint for linting
5. Zod for form validation and type safety

### Design choices:
- I went with these colors because blue I think is a very corporate, sales befitting color.
- I originally wanted to include moving gradients as the background but the implementation was taking too much time so I decided to shelf that idea.
- Most of the time was spent in tinkering with colors etc. for the colorscheme to look consistent in both light and dark modes.
- I've mostly used inter and geist fonts, with the logo being the fraunces serif family.
